# JetParameters
Code to calculate jet parameters

jet_parameters is the main file containing the JetParam class with all the equations to calculate jet quantities. norm.py, eos.py, and physconst.py are helper modules.

jet.py is a minimum example of how to use the class.

Note: If you choose input_param = 'chi', then pratio is ignored and calculated from chi. If you choose input_param = 'pratio', then chi is ignored and calculated from pratio.
